## WHAT HELPED US MAKING THIS MODEL
-  Github Copilot played a very pivotal role in creating this project in very/no time.
-  80% of the whole code is auto generated by copilot with the prompt given as comments.
-  The whole code was not only generated on its own but in addition was more readable and very efficient
